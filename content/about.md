Software developer based in Berlin, currently working on a project supported by the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/).
Previously open source at Twitter, machine learning infrastructure at Stripe, and an assistant director at [MITH](https://mith.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland.

In 2015 I created a [Scala library](https://github.com/circe/circe) that now has hundreds of contributors, averages around ten million monthly downloads from Maven Central,
and is often included in lists of favorite Scala libraries.
Now I mostly write software that nobody uses but me, or that [makes people very angry](https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tucker-libs-of-tiktok-hit-is-obviously-an-intimidation-campaign), or both.

According to the [Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/politics/how-to-lose-an-election-scomo-style-20220817-p5bai6),
I played a role in killing Scott Morrison's chances of remaining prime minister in 2022,
and a [US congressperson has threatened to pull US military bases out of Germany](https://web.archive.org/web/20220420155609/https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1516803554618531849) because of one of my projects. I'm currently [suing the richest man on earth](https://www.wired.com/story/x-twitter-ban-critics/) (or at least one of his companies).

My data collection and analysis projects have been cited in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/23/technology/twitter-elon-musk-twitter-blue-check-verification.html),
